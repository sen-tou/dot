# dot

My .dotfiles

## Install 

For install see: [init_dotfiles.sh](init_dotfiles.sh)

This will overwrite all existing files that you may have created. Make a backup. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

There is an alias `dot` that you can use to manage your home directory 
from any directory.

If you wanna create your own dotfile repo make sure to check your workspace
with `dot status` and check if there are any private files that you DO NOT
want to push to github. 

Add them to `.gitignore` to not accidentally check them in.
